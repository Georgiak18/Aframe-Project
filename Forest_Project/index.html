        <p>To win do the following:
        <ol>
          <p>Collect 10 fruit</p>
          <p>Avoid the Animals</p>
          <p>Utilize safe zone</p>
       
          <p>To move around the world, use the arrows keys and to collect the fruit use the mouse. </p>
          <p>The general purpose of my virtual reality experience is to allow the user to explore the forest and interact with the trees; picking apples from them 
	and everytime a fruit is collected, a counter will show up on the screen.</p>
	<p>The user will also be chased by animals such as wolves and bears once they get too close. </p>
  <p>When you win and you want to play again, refresh your screen.</p>
       </ol>
