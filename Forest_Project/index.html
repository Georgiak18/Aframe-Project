        <p>To win do the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Collect 20 fruit</li>
          <li>Avoid the Animals</li>
          <li>Utilize safe zone</li>
        </ol>
        To move around the world, use the arrows keys and to collect the fruit use the mouse. 
	The general purpose of my virtual reality experience is to allow the user to explore the forest and interact with the trees; picking fruit from them such as apples and oranges 
	and everytime a fruit is collected, a counter will show up on the screen. 
	The user will also be chased by animals such as wolves and bears once they get too close.
